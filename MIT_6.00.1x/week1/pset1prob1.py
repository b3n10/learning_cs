Problem 1
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:

Number of vowels: 5
"""
# Paste your code into this box
vowels = 0

for x in s:
    if x == 'a' or x == 'e' or x == 'i' or x == 'o' or x == 'u':
        vowels += 1

print(vowels)
